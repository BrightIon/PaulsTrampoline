# A simplified model

- gravitational potential energy
- ideal quadrupole landscape
- sinusoidal oscillation
- neglect rolling dynamics, bouncing dynamics, elasticity effects, deformations caused by the ball...

# Some realistic numbers

Stable trapping depends on what is called the 'q parameter'. Values between 0.5 and 0.8 are most stable, above 0.9 is certainly going to be unstable.
It scales linearly with curvature of the parabolic surface and inverse-square with the drive frequency.

Turns out the ball mass doesn't affect the q parameter! (but I expect some secondary effects to scale with ball mass and size).

> There is a second 'a parameter' related to a global tilt of the trampoline which affects stability. In essence the waggling can stabilise against modest tilt, but not large tilt. It would be great to add adjustible legs to the entire trampoline rig to give some freedom to delilberately tilt or level the sheet.

# Stable speed ranges

(for a sheet size of `R_0=0.15`) the likely viable drive frequencies (`F` in Hz) for various realistic waggling amplitudes (`H_0` in meters) are indicated by green cells in the matrix.

There is a [spreadsheet](./TrampolineMaths.xlsx) to allow experimentation with different values
